# Credit Card Fraud Detection
# In this project, the objective is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset. It involves exploring transactional data and applying machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. Techniques such as resampling, feature scaling, and model evaluation metrics like precision and recall are used to improve accuracy and reduce false negatives, which are critical in fraud detection.
